                With my advisor, Dr. Michael Dunham, at Middlebury college, 
                I look into the outflows of protostars (stars that have not 
                started fusion). These outflows an effect of their magnetic
                field. The reason we look at them is because they are a proposed
                mechanism for mass removal. When a protostar forms from a giant 
                molecular cloud, approximately two-thirds of the mass of the cloud 
                is lost in the formation of the star.
